3 checks in tfsec are setup to be ignored based on our 2 requirements shown below

1. we need the terraform code to get PI metrics for all RDS databases in the given account 
2. we also want to use server side encryption for data at rest in our firehose failed backup S3 storage bucket using Amazon managed keys (SSE-S3)

Look for comment lines in terraform code with "#tfsec:ignore" to locate these ignored settings.
